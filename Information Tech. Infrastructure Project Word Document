Machines
Corp40 Machine 1:
•	The machine is running Microsoft Server 2016 and is connected to switch 2, enabling communication with the router.
•	This machine serves as a backbone for Active Directory, email, and web server.
•	It handles port forwarding, as it holds the DNS records required for routing traffic to the appropriate destinations.
•	Machine 1 operates within 40.128.0.1 SM, and the router as its default gateway.

Corp40 Machine 2:
•	Machine 2 is utilizing Ubuntu on the Linux system. 
•	The primary function of this machine is to operate FTP.
•	It is connected to switch 2, enabling communication with the router.
•	Machine 2 is operating in 40.128.0.1 subnet, and its default gateway is the router.
Corp40 Switch 2:
•	The switch provides connectivity between Machine 1 and Machine 2 to the router. 
•	The switch enables both machines to be simultaneously connected to the router. 

Corp40 Router:
•	The router is responsible for managing port forwarding, established in its OpenWrt interface, including DNS, FTP, Web Traffic, HTTPS, and DHCP.
•	The router serves as the central hub for all data transfers and operating activities of the machines.
•	It manages WAN traffic and utilizes the port forward to route traffic efficiently.
•	The router separates the network into two subnets, on which the machines operate.

Corp40 Switch 1:
•	The switch connects Machine 3 to the router, facilitating communication between the two devices.

Corp40 Machine 3:
•	This machine runs Windows 10 and servers as an interface for various operations. 
•	It is used to access the router’s OpenWrt interface via web browser.
•	A remote desktop connection is established on this machine, allowing a wireless client to access it.
•	Machine 3 serves as a test computer in many respects and represents how one could configure a machine.

WAP:
•	WAP is responsible for projecting a wireless signal, allowing devices to connect wirelessly.
•	When a machine is connected to the WAP, it allows the user to utilize remote desktop and access Machine 3 as an Active Directory user.
Connection Services

DNS:
•	Machine 1 runs the DNS and is responsible for routing traffic based on the destination.
•	The DNS installation was completed by adding a feature to the server manager.
•	To enable access to different hosts, DNS host records had to be created on Machine 1 to direct the traffic to the correct location.
•	A port forward was established to send outside traffic from the router to Machine 1, allowing the DNS record to be utilized for routing.

DHCP: 
•	The DHCP is responsible for configuring Machine 3 and distributing it across the network.
•	It enabled IP addresses to be dynamic and still recognized on the network. 
•	To set up the server, we had to configure the router and manually create a new DHCP server.
•	We also configured our own DNS and network settings until the DHCP server was operating correctly. 

Active Directory: 
•	Machine 1 has Active Directory installed, which is a server feature integrated into the Windows software.
•	Configuring Active Directory enables the assignment of roles and responsibilities to different users and machines.
•	It provides the ability to select administrators and device access permissions.
•	The Ubuntu server is configured to join the Active Directory using the command terminal.
•	This integration allows a secure access to the network, approving a user as needed.

FTP Server:
•	Machine 2, running Ubuntu, has the FTP server configured.
•	To use the FTP functions, we first installed the FTP package.
•	A directory was created to store files that were transferred over the network.
•	The server was configured to allow specific users access to it.
•	A port forward was created to route external traffic to a DNS record on Machine 1, which then directs information to Machine 2 where the FTP server operates.

Remote Desktop:
•	Remote desktops were configured on all machines to allow remote access. 
•	On Machine 3, the remote desktop feature was enabled, and a port forward was set up to allow external traffic.
•	A DNS host record was created on Machine 1 to route traffic to Machine 3.
•	Users were authenticated using their existing Active Directory credentials.

Email Server:
•	We installed two programs on Machine 1 to create an email server: Exchange, which is responsible for managing its configuration and maintenance, and another program to handle SMTP communication.
•	To allow external emails to reach the email server, we created MX records on Machine 1 to route traffic to the DNS record that was created.
•	We set up a mailbox on the email server, to send and receive emails both internally and externally.
